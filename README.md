HOW TO USE!

For PC:
	Go to file explorer and type
	%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\LucasArts\LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga\SavedGames
	into the path bar. There you will find your PC saves

For Wii:
	If you are using dolphin, go to your games save directory by right clicking. Do not export the save file

For Xbox 360:
	Find your save file for the game. Nothing else needed
	
For PS3:
	Use the included PS3 Save Regsigner application to decrypt the save file, then edit it, drop on the tool and then re-encrypt it
	Be Sure to follow the instructions for the application
	
Simply drag your modified save onto the "Drag save file onto me!" file to generate a new checksum for it so that it can be used in game
