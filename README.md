## HOW TO USE!
Simply drag your modified save onto the "Drag save file onto me!" file to generate a new checksum for it so that it can be used in game.

## Finding your save files
### For Windows PC:
Go to file explorer and type\
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\LucasArts\LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga\SavedGames`\
into the path bar. There you will find your PC saves.\
&nbsp;

### For Wii:
If you are using Dolphin, go to your game's save directory by right clicking the game and pressing `Open Wii Save Folder`. Do not export the save file.\
&nbsp;

### For Xbox 360 and Xbox:
Find your save file for the game. Nothing else is needed.\
&nbsp;

### For PS3:
Use an application called PS3 Save Regsigner to decrypt the save file, then edit it, drop it on the tool, and then re-encrypt it.\
Be sure to follow the instructions for the application.\
