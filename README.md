# LSWSCU

The LSWSCU (Lego Star Wars Save Checksum Updater) is a tool used for updating the checksums in save files that the games use to validate the file, incase it has been modified or corrupted.

## How to use?
Simply drag your save onto the "Drag save file onto me!" python script (python required) or .exe file. This will generate a new checksum for the save file, which will pass the checksum check that the game will perform when loading a save file, allowing you to use it. ALWAYS MAKE BACKUPS OF YOUR SAVE FILES. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM
